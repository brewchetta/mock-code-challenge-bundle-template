# mock-code-challenge-bundle-template

This is a tool developed to make it easier to bundle mock code challenges (or real ones) for the Flatiron School program.

## Getting Started

Move your designated code challenge file into this directory and rename the directory to `code-challenge`. Then run `ruby bin/create` and it should automatically bundle the code challenge for you. This will remove it as a `git` repo. 

From there you can use your own zipping tool to properly zip the directory and distribute to students via slack or canvas.
